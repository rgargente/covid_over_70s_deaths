# COVID19 England rate of deaths aged over 70

As the UK older population is vaccinated, I would expect to see a reduction in deaths not just in absolute numbers but also in relative numbers compared to other age groups that are not yet as protected by vaccination.

I thought this would be a small interesting data science exercise, and also a way to use this data in an optimistic way that shows how science is helping to save the lives of the most vulnerable and offering us a way out of this very tragic situation.

For simplicity, I used just the data for England because it's the largest population dataset that was readily available.
